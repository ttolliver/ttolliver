	<p id ="cvtext">I came across an advertisement for the open positions listed above
	 and felt that my enthusiastic
	 <br />
	 and productive personality 
	would fit perfectly with Information Management Services mission. 
	</p>


	 <p>Most of the requirements and or skills that you have listed in the job post are the skills I have possesed for over 2 years now.
	 <br />
	  Those particular skills include knowledge of python and PHP. 
	 I built this website with HTML,CSS, PHP and very little javascript.
	 <br />
	  I do build websites for fun and I often volunteer for small projects when I have free time to do so. This is a hobby for me instead of a job.
	  <br />
	  I have acquired excellent verbal and written communication skills as well as time management skills from previous employers and schooling.
	  <br />
	   I am an effective team player and can meet tight deadlines by multi-tasking as well as having an efficient system for meeting specific deadlines.
	 </p>

	 <p>It would be an honor to find out more about these two positions and which one would be a best suit for Information Management Services
	 <br />
	  to place me in.I am available to attend an interview at any time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
